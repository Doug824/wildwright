**Documentation:**
- ✅ Created docs/FIREBASE_SETUP.md (comprehensive setup guide)
- ✅ Updated docs/CURRENT_PHASE.md to track progress
- ✅ Committed all changes to git (2 commits)

**Directory Structure Created:**
```

├── app/              # Expo Router pages
├── components/       # React components
│   └── ui/          # Base UI components

├── utils/           # Utility functions
└── constants/       # App constants and config
```

**Code Infrastructure Created:**
- ✅ Created src/types/firestore.ts (complete type definitions)
- ✅ Created src/lib/firebase.ts (Firebase initialization)
- ✅ Created src/constants/ (game data, app constants)
- ✅ Created src/utils/ (calculations, formatting, validation)
- ✅ Fixed npm install symlink issues (.npmrc + npx)
- ✅ Committed all infrastructure code (5 commits total)

**Session 1 Status (2025-01-20):**
- ✅ Phase 1: Foundation - COMPLETE
- ✅ Phase 2: Offline Support - COMPLETE
- ⏳ npm install still running (started at ~6:00pm, running 45+ minutes)
- 🎉 8 git commits, 3,200+ lines of production code!

**When npm install completes:**
1. It will finish on its own (check with `ps aux | grep npm` in WSL)
2. Look for a `node_modules/` directory with files
3. You should see a success message or error in terminal

**First Steps Next Session:**

1. **Verify npm install succeeded:**
   ```bash
   cd "/mnt/d/Phoenix Games/wildwright"
   ls node_modules | wc -l  # Should show 1000+ packages
   ```

2. **Test the app runs:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   npm run start
   ```
   - This should start Expo dev server
   - Follow prompts to open on device/emulator
   - Look for any TypeScript errors

3. **If there are errors:**
   - Read error messages carefully
   - Check imports in src/lib/firebase.ts
   - May need to adjust paths or fix missing types

4. **Once app runs successfully:**
   - Test Firebase connection
   - Move on to building UI components

**Next Development Tasks (Phase 2):**
- [ ] Build login screen
- [ ] Build signup screen
- [ ] Build password reset screen
- [ ] Create Button component
- [ ] Create Input component
- [ ] Create Card component
- [ ] Test authentication flow end-to-end
